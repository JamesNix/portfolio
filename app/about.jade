            From Hack to Hacker

        h4.deck An ongoing journey

        p.
          After a successful career in journalism was disrupted by one of the industry's ubiquitous layoffs, I decided to go back to school to revisit another passion of mine—technology.
          I've set out on a mission to learn to code, to create clean, logical websites and apps,
          and to learn the correct way to accomplish these tasks. I seek to "practice" coding and programming the way one practices medicine or law.
          Having graduated the Nashville Software School program in the summer, I'm well on my way to that goal but with the knowledge that
          I'll never be done learning.

        p.
          In the fall of 2014 I continued to learn and engage in the Nashville development community by volunteering with the
          fledgling <a href='http://codefornashville.org'>Code for Nashville</a> where I helped launch <a href='http://nashvilleflushots.org'>nashvilleflushots.org</a>
          that helps Nashville residents find out information on where to get flu shots and how much they cost at each location this winter. 
          I also worked on the Code for Nashville team at this year's <a href='http://hacknashville.com/'>Hack Nashville</a> to develop an app (NashViva) that uses the Nashville Open Data Portal
          to provide info on public resources for would-be residents, such as locations of police precincts, fire stations, parks and more amenities.
          That app is being refined by full CfN brigade and is unpublished to date. I also attended and volunteered to help out with <a href='http://www.barcampnashville.org'>BarCamp Nashville</a>. 

        p.
          Here are many of the concepts, applications and frameworks that I've worked with so far:
        hr
        .row#list
          .col-md-4
            ul.list
              li HTML
              li CSS
              li JavaScript
              li Ruby on Rails

              li AJAX
              li jQuery
              li Foundation

        p.
          Some of these I know pretty well, of others I have just a passing knowledge. Sometimes
          I feel like a kid surrounded by shiny things, wanting to reach out and explore them all
          at once.

        p.
          The links on the portfolio page illustrate a few of the programs I've made as part of the
          NSS learning experience as well as on my own. Both the Shell and Memory games demonstrate the use of JavaScript and
          jQuery to dynamically manipulate DOM elements. Quiz-O-Matic adds data sets to the equation.
          And Fireside Chat is my capstone project for the client-side portion of the NSS bootcamp.
          It utilizes an API to read and write data to a Firebase database using only client-side Javascript.

        p.
          What I Got is a home media management app meant to catalog books, movies and albums as well
          as home electronics for insurance purposes. It represents both my capstone project for the NSS
          Ruby on Rails portion of the school and my first solo Rails project aside from a couple open
          source projects I contributed to at NSS. What I Got is now a pet project to continue learning
          and tinkering with, beginning with its responsiveness to various devices.

        p.
          I have also created a <a href="http://jamesnix.co">WordPress site</a> that I'll use to explore working with and customizing 
          various WordPress themes, and managing a WordPress site in general.

        p.
          What all of this represents, however, is my ability to learn these concepts and turn
          that into practice. I will continue update this site as I learn and accomplish more.
