</h2><h4 class="deck">An ongoing journey</h4><hr><p>About six months ago, as of this writing, I knew only enough HTML and CSS
to rearrange a website. I've come a long way since.
</p><p>A year out from being laid off from a job in the thriving world of
print journalism, I've taken a detour back to another passion of mine—technology.
I've set out on a mission to learn to code, to create clean, logical websites and apps,
and to learn the correct way to accomplish these tasks. Halfway through the Nashville Software
School program, I'm well on my way to that goal but with the knowledge that
I'll never be done learning.
</p><p>Here are many of the concepts, applications and frameworks that I've worked with so far:</p><hr><div id="list" class="row"><div class="col-md-4"><ul class="list"><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>SQL databases</li><li>AJAX</li><li>jQuery</li><li>Foundation</li><li>Bootstrap</li></ul></div><div class="col-md-4"><ul class="list"><li>Underscore</li><li>Lo-Dash</li><li>Less</li><li>Jade</li><li>Haml</li><li>Sass</li><li>Slim</li><li>AWS</li><li>Vim/Atom/Sublime</li></ul></div><div class="col-md-4"><ul class="list"><li>Test Driven Development</li><li>Command line usage</li><li>Capybara</li><li>Heroku</li><li>Git and GitHub</li><li>TDD testing</li><li>Pair programming</li><li>Object Oriented Programming</li></ul></div></div><hr><p>Some of these I know pretty well, of others I have just a passing knowledge. Sometimes
I feel like a kid surrounded by shiny things, wanting to reach out and explore them all
at once.
</p><p>The links in the carousel above take you to a few of the programs I've made as part of the
learning experience. Both the Shell and Memory games demonstrate the use of JavaScript and
jQuery to dynamically manipulate DOM elements. Quiz-O-Matic adds data sets to the equation.
And Fireside Chat is my capstone project for the client-side portion of the NSS bootcamp.
It utilizes an API call to read and write data to a Firebase database using only client-side Javascript.
</p><p>What I Got is a home media management app meant to catalog books, movies and albums as well
as home electronics for insurance purposes. It represents both my capstone project for the NSS
Ruby on Rails portion of the school and my first solo Rails project aside from a couple open
source projects I contributed to at NSS. What I Got is now a pet project to continue learning
and tinkering with, beginning with its responsiveness to various devices.
</p><p>I have also created a <a href="http://jamesnix.co">WordPress site</a> that I'll use to explore working with and customizing 
various WordPress themes, and managing a WordPress site in general.
</p><p>What all of this represents, however, is my ability to learn these concepts and turn
that into practice. I will continue update this site as I learn and accomplish more.
